## Assignment-Scratch

Implement a Scratch project with the following requirements:
	- Use at least two sprites (please, for my sake, no cats).
	- Have at least three scripts or threads total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
	- Must use at least one condition or one loop.
	- Must use at least one variable.
	- Must use at least one sound.

SUBMIT our Scratch Project as an .sb3 file in CANVAS.
