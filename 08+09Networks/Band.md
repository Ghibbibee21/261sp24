You + your group mates are a new band.
Build a simple band website together using pages.github.com where your index.html file has
at least:
- one header
- 3 paragraph sections (bios for each of you in the band)
- 3 other assets: could be a hyperlink, a Gif/image, a css file, etc.

You will PRESENT at 4pm Next Class,
Documentation is due at Midnight that night

Every group member submits an individual markdown file to Canvas. The markdown file
must include:
- A hyperlink to the site you all made
- Problems faced, decisions made (as in other weeks)
- A self-assessment of how you contributed to the group
- Short assessments of your group members and the contributions they made
