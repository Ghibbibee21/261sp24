## Python Reading

Read Chapters 1 "The way of the Program"; 3 "Functions"; and 5 "Conditionals and recursion" in Think Python by Allen Downey.

Make a MarkDown file (.md) in your itp repository that outlines one thing you knew and one thing you did not know for each chapter of the reading (6 observations total), then submit that link in CANVAS!
